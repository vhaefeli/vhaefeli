### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vanessa. I have an engineering degree in microtechnology but it's mainly at the 42Lausanne school that I learned to code.

I learned C, C++ and for the last projet Typescript and a lot more.
I just also started to learn to use Angular and I find it very nice to use.

I have a preference for the frontend which speaks more to my artist side. But I also like to solve problems. In our Transcendence project https://github.com/vhaefeli/42_transcendence I loved doing the front of the login and the game pages, but also doing the calculations behind it. (the drawing of the arcade machine ðŸŽ® is by MichÃ¨le https://github.com/Michele-Reymond ðŸ’œ)

I look forward to creat my websites with something other than Wordpress.

I have worked more than 15 years in the watch industry and now I'm looking for a job that has more sens for me. I want to create and do things that help people and are more environmentally friendly and sustainable.

I particularly like talking to people and finding out what they really need to make their life easier.
